# AEM CIF Core Components

AEM Commerce reference store front project that serves as accelerator to get started with projects using AEM, CIF and Magento. The project contains re-useable Commerce core components as well as a complete sample store front serving as documentation and showing best practices. The store front combines server-side rendered AEM components with client-side React commerce components (MPA) for dynamic experiences / data. The components use the [Venia](https://github.com/magento-research/pwa-studio/tree/develop/packages/venia-concept) theme<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.

This project is intended to be used in conjunction with the [AEM Sites Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components). AEM CIF Core Components use the AEM Sites Core Components as a foundation where possible and extending them.

## System Requirements

The latest version of the AEM CIF Core Components, require the below minimum system requirements:

| CIF Core Components | AEM 6.4 | AEM 6.5 | Magento | Java |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ---- |
| 0.0.1               | 6.4.4.0 | 6.5.0   | 2.3.1   | 1.8  |

### AEM Commerce connector for Magento

This project uses the [AEM Commerce connector for Magento](https://github.com/adobe/commerce-cif-connector) to improve the authoring experience by leveraging the product pickers, product assets view and consoles provided by the connector package.

### AEM Sites Core Components

This project relies on the [AEM Sites Core Components](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components). They are typically installed as part of AEM. If you install AEM without sample content option you have to [deploy them manually](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components#installation) before using the AEM CIF Core Components.

For a list of requirements for previous versions, see [Historical System Requirements](VERSIONS.md).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run a `mvn clean install` in the root folder to install the artifacts to your local Maven repository.
3. Switch to the `all` project and run a `mvn clean install content-package:install`.

Here is a full [video walk trough of the setup process](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/commerce-integration-framework/getting-started.html).

### UberJar

This project relies on the AEM 6.4.4 `cq-quickstart` UberJar. This is publicly available on https://repo.adobe.com

For more details about the UberJar please head over to the
[How to Build AEM Projects using Apache Maven](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/ht-projects-maven.html) documentation page.

## Configuration

To connect the AEM CIF Core Components with your Magento instance follow the [configuration steps](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components/wiki/configuration). For a multi store / site setup one [additional step](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-cif-components/wiki/configuration#multi-store--site-configuration) is needed to link an AEM site to a Magento store view.

## Testing
### Karma Unit Tests
The client-side JavaScript code of the components is covered using Mocha unit tests executed with Karma. Please make sure that for every contribution new client-side code is covered by tests and that all tests pass.

```bash
cd ui.apps
npm install
npm test
```

Karma will test with Chrome and Firefox. Make sure you have both browsers installed.

## Code Formatting
### Java
You can find the code formatting rules in the `eclipse-formatter.xml` file. The code formatting is automatically checked for each build. To automatically format your code, please run:
```bash
mvn clean install -Pformat-code
```

### JavaScript & CSS
For formatting JavaScript and CSS we use [prettier](https://prettier.io/). The formatting is automatically checked when running `npm test` in the `ui.apps` project. To automatically format your code, please run the following command in `ui.apps`:
```bash
npm run prettier-fix
```
