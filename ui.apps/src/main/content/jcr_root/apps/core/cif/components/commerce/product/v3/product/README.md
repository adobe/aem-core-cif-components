Product (v3)
====
The version 3 of the product component extends the v2 product component by extending the v2 GraphQL query with the `uid` field for product variants and variant attributes in Magento 2.4.0 . This hence requires that the Magento backend is at least version 2.4.0 because the query with the `uid` fields will be rejected by Magento versions not having this field in the GraphQL schema.
