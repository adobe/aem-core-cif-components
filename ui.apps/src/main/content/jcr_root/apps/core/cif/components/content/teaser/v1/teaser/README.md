Commerce Teaser (v1)
====
Commerce Teaser component written in HTL extends core wcm component Teaser, In addition to allowing definition of an image, title, rich text description and actions/links it also supports Call-To-Action to a commerce product or category page.
Teaser variations can include some or all of these elements.

## Features
* Call to action linked to CIF Product or Category.
* Combines image, title, rich text description and actions/links.
* Allows disabling of teaser elements through policy configuration.
* Allows control over whether title and description should be inherited from a linked page.

### Use Object
This component uses (specifically for  `action` node processing) `com.adobe.cq.commerce.core.components.models.teaser.CommerceTeaser` Sling Model as it's use Object.
And as CommerceTeaser component is extended from core wcm Teaser component, it further uses the `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models.Teaser` Sling model as its Use-object,  

### Component Policy Configuration Properties
The following configuration properties are used:

1. `./actionsDisabled` - defines whether or not Call-to-Actions are disabled
2. `./titleHidden` - defines whether or not the title is hidden
3. `./descriptionHidden` - defines whether or not the description is hidden
4. `./imageLinkHidden` - defines whether or not the image link is hidden
5. `./titleLinkHidden` - defines whether or not the title link is hidden
6. `./titleType` - stores the value for this title's HTML element type

The following configuration properties are inherited from the image component:

1. `./allowedRenditionWidths` - defines the allowed renditions (as an integer array) that will be generated for the images rendered by this
component; the actual size will be requested by the client device
2. `./disableLazyLoading` - if `true`, the lazy loading of images (loading only when the image is visible on the client
device) is disabled

### Edit Dialog Properties
The following properties are written to JCR for this Teaser component and are expected to be available as `Resource` properties:

1. `./actionsEnabled` - property that defines whether or not the teaser has Call-to-Action elements
2. `./actions` - child node where the Call-to-Action elements are stored as a list of `item` nodes with the following properties
    1. `productSlug` - property that stores the Call-to-Action link to a product page for selected product.
    2. `categoryID` - property that stores the Call-to-Action to Selected category, it is preferred over `productSlug`.
    3. `text` - property that stores the Call-to-Action text
3. `./fileReference` - property or `file` child node - will store either a reference to the image file, or the image file
4. `./linkURL` - link applied to teaser elements. URL or path to a content page
5. `./jcr:title` - defines the value of the teaser title and HTML `title` attribute of the teaser image
6. `./titleFromPage` - defines whether or not the title value is taken from the linked page
7. `./jcr:description` - defines the value of the teaser description
8. `./descriptionFromPage` - defines whether or not the description value is taken from the linked page

### Extending the Teaser Component
When extending the Teaser component by using `sling:resourceSuperType`, developers need to define the `imageDelegate` property for
the proxy component and point it to the designated Image component.

For example:
```
imageDelegate="core/wcm/components/image/v2/image"
```
