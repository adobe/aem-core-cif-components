# UI tests

This folder contains UI tests that test some client-side (= clientlib) features of the CIF components. The tests are based on the sample content of the [CIF components library](../examples). To execute the tests with a local AEM instance, simply setup and install the CIF components library. Make sure you also install the GraphQL client version >= `1.6.1` so you no longer have to setup HTTPS.

To execute the tests, simply run

```
mvn verify -Pui-tests-local-execution
```

## Requirements

* Maven
* Chrome and/or Firefox browser installed locally in default location
* An AEM author instance running at http://localhost:4502


#### Remarks
* After execution, reports and logs are available in `test-module/reports` folder
* If you receive an error message like:
    ```
    This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version XX.
    ```

    Try setting the `CHROMEDRIVER` environment variable to a version that matches your currently installed Chrome version. You can find matching versions at https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads.

    Example:

    ```bash
    CHROMEDRIVER=87.0.4280.20 mvn verify -Pui-tests-local-execution
    ```
