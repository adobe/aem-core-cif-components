# GraphQL queries

This folder contains the list of GraphQL queries "generated" by the server-side components during unit testing. This can help developers understand the types of queries executed by the components, especially when implementing a 3rd-party integration for another commerce platform.

Due to the limitations of unit testing, we do not guarantee that this list covers all the queries generated by the components in a real production setup. Also note that this folder does **not** contain the queries generated by the client-side components. These queries can be found in the [/react-components/src/queries](/react-components/src/queries) folder.

The file `graphql-requests.log` is generated automatically by the logger configured in [../logback-test.xml](../logback-test.xml), do NOT edit it manually.
